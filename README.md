## Introduction
Network anomalies can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information resources. This project uses anomaly detection techniques to analyze network traffic data and identify potential threats. The approach involves preprocessing network data, selecting features, and applying machine learning algorithms to distinguish between normal and anomalous traffic.

## Data Preparation
The dataset consists of network traffic records, including both normal operations and potential security incidents. The preparation process involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data to remove irrelevant features and normalize the remaining ones.
- Feature selection to identify the most informative attributes that contribute to anomaly detection.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model Building
For anomaly detection, various machine learning models are explored, including:

- Clustering models like K-Means for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- Classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines for supervised learning.
- Neural networks and deep learning models for complex pattern recognition in large-scale data.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on their ability to accurately identify anomalies in the test data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess performance. The evaluation process also includes a discussion on the models' strengths and weaknesses in detecting different types of network anomalies.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing network security through anomaly detection. Future work could explore more sophisticated models, larger datasets, and real-time detection systems.
